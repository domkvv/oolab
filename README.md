## Moving animals 

The first project created during the first part of Object-Oriented Programming course labs. üêæüó∫Ô∏è

##### Short description

A java application using gradle puts few animals and plants on a map and enables user to move the animals by typing their move sequence in a text field. Moves can be typed with single letters: `f, b, r, l` or separated by spaces: `forward, backward, right, left`. The move sequence consists of few single sequences in which every animal moves only once, e.g with 3 animals and 5 letters: the moves of the first animal are 1 and 4, second 2 and 5, and the third - only 3. The map bounds are the smallest possible with all animals and plants shown. Animals eat plants - if an animal steps on a square with a plant, the plant disappears.
